# Performance Measurement Metrics

## Description:  
### The performance measurement is similar to risk-return tradeoff. Risk-return states that higher risk with greater probability of higher return and lower risk with a greater probability of smaller return. Therefore, trade off which an investor faces between risk and return will considering investment decisions is called the risk return trade off.  

#### Standard Deviation is the most common measure of risk used in investment and trading. Standard deviation measures the variability of asset's returns.  

#### Beta is a measure of volatility and is similar to standard deviation; however, beta measures volatility in relation to the market as a whole. Beta is use for investment strategy that will tell you how volatile it is when compared to the broader market. A beta of 1 means that the strategy has the same volatility as the market. A beta of less than one indicates lower volatility than the market, while a beta greater one indicates higher volatility than the market.  For example, a higher Beta implies more risk, a lower Beta implies less risk.  

#### Maximum Drawdown is a metric with simple indicator of risk that is both intuitive and easy to understand. Maximum drawdown measures the greatest peak-to-trough decline that an investment strategy experiences over time. As a result, maximum drawdown is expressed as a percentage and reflects the largest price move down from a new high. For example, lower maximum drawdown implies less risk, higher maximum drawdown implies higher risk.
