# The degree of freddom of 372, the critical value is close to a normal distribution (T = 1.96).
# When the value is higher than 1.96, we reject the underlying hypothesis or we accept the hypothesis.
# t-value is 0.83876 is lower than 1.96, we accept the hypthesis.
# Rule of thumb: t-value is less than 2, we accept.
# p-value is 0.4021 and is 40.21%; therefore, is more than 5% and we accept hypothesis.
# 0 is in the range, we accept hypothesis.
