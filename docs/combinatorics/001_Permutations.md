### Detailed Explanation of the Solutions

Both the Python and C++ solutions use **Heap's Algorithm**, an efficient method for generating permutations in-place. I'll explain how the algorithm works, and then break down the **time** and **space complexity** for each version.

#### **Heap's Algorithm Overview**
Heap's Algorithm is an iterative method for generating permutations of a list in-place (without using additional space for the entire result). It works as follows:
1. **Control Array (`c`)**: This array keeps track of how many times each element has been swapped in the current level of the algorithm.
2. **Swapping**: For each position `i`, the algorithm decides whether to swap the element at position `i` with the first element (for even `i`) or with the element at position `c[i]` (for odd `i`).
3. **Permutation Generation**: It generates a new permutation after each swap. The process continues until all permutations have been generated.
4. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when the `c` array contains only zeros, indicating that all permutations have been generated.

### Python3 Solution (Iterative with Yield)

```python
from typing import List, Generator

def generate_permutations(nums: List[int]) -> Generator[List[int], None, None]:
    n = len(nums)
    c = [0] * n  # Control array for the iterative process
    
    yield nums[:]  # Yield the initial permutation
    
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if c[i] < i:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                nums[0], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[0]  # Swap for even i
            else:
                nums[c[i]], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[c[i]]  # Swap for odd i
            yield nums[:]  # Yield the next permutation
            c[i] += 1
            i = 0
        else:
            c[i] = 0
            i += 1
```

#### **Explanation**
- **Initial Setup**: We start with a list `nums` that contains the numbers from 1 to 10 (or any other list). The control array `c` is initialized with zeros and has the same length as `nums`.
- **Yielding the Initial Permutation**: The first permutation (which is just the original list) is yielded immediately.
- **Iterative Loop**: The algorithm iterates through the list, swapping elements and generating new permutations.
  - If `c[i] < i`, it checks whether `i` is even or odd:
    - **Even `i`**: The element at position `i` is swapped with the first element.
    - **Odd `i`**: The element at position `i` is swapped with the element at `c[i]`.
  - The new permutation is yielded after each swap.
  - After a permutation is generated, `c[i]` is incremented, and the index `i` is reset to zero to continue the next round of swaps.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when all permutations have been generated.

#### **Time Complexity**
- **Swap Operations**: For each permutation, the algorithm performs up to `n` swaps, where `n` is the length of the list (`n = 10` in this case).
- **Permutations**: There are `n!` permutations (for `n = 10`, this is `10! = 3,628,800`).
- **Total Time Complexity**: \( O(n \times n!) \), where `n` is the size of the list.
  - Each permutation requires `O(n)` swaps.
  - There are `n!` permutations to generate.

#### **Space Complexity**
- **Control Array**: The `c` array has size `n`, so it requires `O(n)` space.
- **Current Permutation**: The current list of length `n` requires `O(n)` space.
- **Stack Memory**: Since this solution uses `yield`, it doesn't store all permutations in memory at once, only one at a time.
- **Total Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \), which is dominated by the `c` array and the current permutation.

### C++20 Solution (Iterative with In-Place Permutation Generation)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>  // For std::swap

// Function to generate permutations iteratively using Heap's Algorithm in-place
void generate_permutations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> c(n, 0);  // Control array
    
    // Output the first permutation
    for (int num : nums) std::cout << num << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    int i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        if (c[i] < i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                std::swap(nums[0], nums[i]);  // Swap for even i
            } else {
                std::swap(nums[c[i]], nums[i]);  // Swap for odd i
            }
            // Output the next permutation
            for (int num : nums) std::cout << num << " ";
            std::cout << std::endl;

            c[i] += 1;
            i = 0;
        } else {
            c[i] = 0;
            ++i;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    generate_permutations(nums);
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation**
- **Initial Setup**: Similar to the Python version, the control array `c` is initialized with zeros, and we start by printing the first permutation, which is the input list itself.
- **Swapping and Printing**: The algorithm swaps elements in place using `std::swap` for each permutation. After each swap, the new permutation is printed.
  - **Even `i`**: Swap `nums[0]` with `nums[i]`.
  - **Odd `i`**: Swap `nums[i]` with `nums[c[i]]`.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates after all permutations have been printed.

#### **Time Complexity**
- **Swap Operations**: As in the Python version, each permutation requires up to `n` swaps.
- **Permutations**: The number of permutations is `n!`.
- **Total Time Complexity**: \( O(n \times n!) \), since each of the `n!` permutations requires `O(n)` swaps.

#### **Space Complexity**
- **Control Array**: The `c` array has size `n`, so it requires `O(n)` space.
- **In-Place Permutation**: The list `nums` is permuted in-place, which requires no additional space beyond the input.
- **Stack Memory**: Since the solution generates and prints each permutation directly, there is no need to store all permutations in memory.
- **Total Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \), which comes from the control array and the input list.

### Summary of Time and Space Complexities

| Metric             | Python3 (Iterative with Yield) | C++20 (Iterative with In-Place) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Time Complexity** | \( O(n \times n!) \)           | \( O(n \times n!) \)            |
| **Space Complexity**| \( O(n) \)                    | \( O(n) \)                     |

### Key Points:
1. **Time Complexity**: Both solutions have the same time complexity of \( O(n \times n!) \) because the algorithm generates `n!` permutations, and each permutation requires `O(n)` operations (swaps).
   
2. **Space Complexity**: Both solutions are space-efficient with \( O(n) \) complexity. The control array (`c`) and the current list take up space proportional to the size of the input list (`n`). However, neither solution stores all permutations at once, making them both more memory efficient than storing all `n!` permutations.
