# Probability

## Exercise Survey Problem

### Problem Description
- 1000 people were asked about their preferred method of exercise.

- The following table shows the results, grouped by age: 

| | 18-22 | 23-27 | 28-32 | 33-37 | Total |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Run|54|40|42|66|202|
|Bike|77|68|90|70|305|
|Swim|28|43|50|52|173|
|Other|90|78|71|81|320|
|Total|249|229|253|269|1000|

- You meet a 33 year old who took survey. 

- Compute the probability (in fraction) she prefers swimming.

### Solution
- We know that __the person is 33 years old__, which places them in the **33-37 age group**.

- To compute the probability that this person prefers swimming, we need to focus on __the total number of people in the 33-37 age group__ and __the number of people in that age group who prefer swimming__.

- From the table - the total number of people in the __33-37 age group__ is **269**.

- The number of people in the 33-37 age group who prefer swimming is **52**.

The probability __`P`__ that a randomly selected person from the 33-37 age group prefers swimming is given by the ratio of people who prefer swimming to the total number of people in that age group:

$$
P = \frac{52}{269}
$$

Thus, the probability that the 33-year-old prefers swimming is:

$$
\frac{52}{269}
$$
