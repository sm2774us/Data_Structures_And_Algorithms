# Logical Reasoning

## Barn Problem

### Problem Description
You walk into barn and see collection of spiders,chickens and cows. You notice there are 520 legs in total. The number of chickens is twice that of cows and the number of spiders is twice that of chickens, compute the number of spiders.

### Solution
Let's define the variables:
- Let __`c`__ represent __the number of cows__.
- __The number of chickens__ is __`2c`__ since __the number of chickens is twice the number of cows__.
- __The number of spiders__ is __`2(2c) = 4c`__ since __the number of spiders is twice the number of chickens__.

Now, let's calculate __the total number of legs__:
- __Cows have 4 legs__, so __the total number of legs from cows is `4c`__.
- __Chickens have 2 legs__, so __the total number of legs from chickens is `2(2c) = 4c`__.
- __Spiders have 8 legs, so the total number of legs from spiders is `8(4c) = 32c`__.

The total number of legs is given as 520, so we can write the equation:
$$
4c + 4c + 32c = 520
$$

$$
40c = 520
$$

Solving for __`c`__:

$$
c = \frac{520}{40} = 13
$$

The number of spiders is __`4c = 4(13) = 52`__.

Thus, there are **52 spiders**.
